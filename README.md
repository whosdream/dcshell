# Disjoint Convex Shell
#### Yun-hyeong Kim, Zhonghua Xi, Jyh-Ming Lien

Disjoint convex shell(DC-shell) is a set of disjoint convex objects approximating non-convex overapping object sets.
The DC-shell method we proposed provides better approximation than those created by other methods. 
In addition, DC-shell enables faster collision response and realistic fracturing simulation by preventing convex objects from overlapping themselves.

DC-shell implemets the algorithms described in the following paper: 
"Disjoint Convex Shell and its Applications in Mesh Unfolding", SPM 2017, by Yun-hyeong Kim, Zhonghua Xi, and Jyh-Ming Lien.

## Description

The provided code constructs disjoint convex objects from overlapping or segmented parts as inputs.
The code can produce DC-shells created by LSF(least-squares fit) heuristic method, SVM and exact volume optimization methods.
Moreover, before creating DC-shells, we can simplify and remesh the parts to decrease the complexity and increase their regularity.

To demonstrate the power of DC-shell, we studied how DC-shell can be used in mesh unfolding. 
The nets of polyhedra we used were created by [software tools](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/Origami) developed by the [MASC group](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu) at George Mason University. 

## Requirements

The provided code can be run on Mac OS X and it was currently tested on a MacBook Air, with Mac OSX 10.9.5 and 10.11.6.
The required program and library are listed.

* Mac OS X 10.9.5 or newer
* CMake 2.6 or newer

	To install CMake program via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), please type this in the terminal: `$ sudo port install cmake`

* CGAL

	The provided code requires only CGAL to install. Additional libraries are included in the "cshell/lib" directory. 
	To install CGAL via Macports, please type this in the terminal: `$ sudo port install cgal +qt5`

## Instructions

* To compile the provided code, please type the commands below in the "cshell" directory:

		$ chmod +x gen.sh
		$ ./gen.sh

	The provided code can be compiled using the script file, "gen.sh" and create a "cshell" file linked to the execution file.

* To run the provided code, please type the command below in the "cshell" directory, the root dirctory:

		$ ./cshell <model_1.obj> <model_2.obj> ... <model_n.obj>

	This program takes one or more OBJ files. You can try to run this program following several steps in the Usage Section. 
	(**NOTE**: if you want to get disjoint convex objects from a given model, you need to segment it before running the the code.)

* To create figures or tables or plots our paper contains, please type this in the "cshell/models/\*" directory: 
	
		$ sh run

	Once you type the script file, "run", it creates a "cshell" file linked to the execution file and it runs with the segmented objects in the directory.
	please consult the detailed description in the [wiki page](https://github.com/yunhkim/dcshell/wiki). 

## Usage

Here are somethings to try \\\\\\\\\\:
All of the functions in this program are listed in the [wiki page](https://github.com/yunhkim/dcshell/wiki). 

1. Run the DC-shell program by typing this in the "cshell" directory: `$ ./cshell models/yoshi-sep.obj`
	* Once you run the program and it would open both a window(left) and a control panel(right). You might see like this:

<img src="./window.jpg" height="400" alt="window"> <img src="./control_panel.jpg" height="400" alt="control_panel">

2. Press **h** to show the convex hulls.
3. Press **simplify hulls** to simplify the convex hulls.
4. Press **trim hulls** to make the hulls disjoint.
	* Two important parameters are **surface sample density** and **c-svm C**
			
		* Increase **surface sample density** will reduce the number of samples used and speeds up computation
		* **c-svm C** affects both running time and output quality lower. The value increases both computation time and output quality.

5. Once all convex ojects are trimmed and disjoint, then save the resulted objects by clicking **Save Hulls** and then you can use mesh unfolder to unfold each convex hull.

## Models

Many models used in this paper are obtained from http://thingiverse.com and all Pokemon models are from roestudios.co.uk/project/3d-pokemon-models/.
In the "cshell/models" directory, all those models were manually segmented into several parts.
